# NetWorker
NetWorker is a site that allows professionals to find mentors, mentees, and other people to network with, unified by their shared interests and backgrounds.

This project was originally made for Major League Hacking's Hack Your Portfolio hackathon. In this project, I was one of the UUI/UX Designers, and my resposibility entailed conceptualizing the project's features, doing research and creating the home page's components. This repository contains my work.

You can find the completed project [on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/networker-i4qzdg) and the source code [in this repository.](https://github.com/amaciasmar/Networker)
